What is Tame the World?
At it's core, The Tame the World aims at 3 Core Elements
Difficult enough to please most folks who were looking for a Minecraft that wasn't afraid of them even in Diamond Armor
Allowing for Large, Comprehensive, and Aesthetically pleasing builds
Rewarding Exploration of both World and Game
I was inspired by a few Modpacks that exist out there today, including Hubris, There Will be Blood, and Simplicity. The Truth is that I really liked these modpacks, but each of them had their own elements that really didn't fit with my play style. Hubris world was almost Too harsh, There Will Be Blood's progressions system broke so much from traditional Minecraft that it was difficult to get settled into, and Simplicity was fun and had at it's core what I wanted but lacked certain touches that I felt made the world harsh enough.

The objective of the Mod pack is to make the world Harsh and Unforgiving but at the same time still allowing the player to build magnificent structures that show they really can and did tame the world. Exploration should be rewarded with more then simply finding more of an item you can already craft, it should be unique things that don't make the game impossible without, but do make it easier.

And Finally I didn't wish to break Minecraft's simple formula too much. Iguana Tweaks and Tinker's construct, these mods are fine on their own right, but I feel that they take away from the heart of Minecraft, they make it so that someone who knows vanilla but doesn't know the modded world would be so horribly at a loss they wouldn't know where to start. I wanted to make it possible for a Vanilla minecraft player to feel like they could get started without Feeling completely at a loss.

FAQ
Where Is...? 
Blood Magic - I actually added blood magic initially but pulled it from later releases for multiple reasons. The most obvious is that while Witchery, Thaumcraft, and others have a very internalized progression system. Blood Magic's ultimately revolves around it's most central aspect, the blood alter. What it added to the game was more grindy (To me) then thought provoking. Beyond that There were already 3 very competent Magic mods on the list and I felt the addition of a 4th would be overkill
AE2 - In Truth? I don't feel it really fits with the spirit of to the mod. It has it's own internalized complexity sure, but much like Tinker's construct (which I am about to get into) I feel it takes an element of Minecraft and devalues it (storage and crafting) to the point where it is no longer really the same game. Sure Botania's little ring hud does similar, but I feel as if AE2 takes an element of play and lessens it. (it was considered though I promise)
Tinkers Construct - I like Ticon, I think it's a perfectly good mod... just not for what I'm looking for. I felt that TiCon not only makes the Vanilla Tools Obsolete, but it also makes obsolete the other tools offered by other mods. It completely strips any other mod of their tools because frankly they just won't ever be better. And the primary way to balance it (Iguana Tweaks) makes the game even more unfriendly to new players
Ender IO - Aestetically and thematically I just wasn't a fan, nothing against Ender IO, it just wasn't the right mod to feel tine "Industrial side" of the pack
CoFH - I thought about this one for a long time, and ultimately I decided the the COFH family of mods just wasn't the right fit. The Progressions wasn't right and It just didn't fit with the Steam Punk feel that i was trying to achieve.
What is ____ doing here? 
Trophy Slots - This one I'm still on the Fence about and I'd like to see how it plays out in Testing. Ultimately I think it could be a very interesting mod for early game, forcing the player to think about their inventory and storage solutions, what is really important on them in those adventures. If it proves to just be an absolute thorn in my side and the players side then we'll drop or tweak it, but for right now I find it interesting
Ex Nihilo - What's a Skyblock mod doing in an adventure game you ask? Welll... at it's core I wanted this to really be an options mod. To give the player a choice about how they wanted to move forward with their resource gathering. I'd like to keep it, even if we need to make some changes to help balance it so it's not the /optimal/ source of resources, I want to make sure at the very least if you really just aren't feeling like caving that you do have an option
Will you add ____ ? 
Ultimately this all depends on how good an argument can be made for it to join the pack, that it fits not only the theme, but the intended vision of game play. For instance I'm keeping a close eye on Mariculture because I feel like that could fit the theme and be interesting, but It's one of those things that I'm going to have to test out and feel out where it fits in. There's also things that may still be removed, Maybe Pneumaticraft just feels to different, or perhaps 3 Magic mods is to many, maybe no one actually wants to go to the twilight forest. At this stage I think this is important to sort through

Development Stages
Alpha
These initial builds are basically going to be figuring out /which/ mods I want to move forward with, which really exemplify the theme of the pack the best, helping sort out which ones feel good, and which ones don't. There could be many world resets during these stages as we try to get a handle on the world Generation (What kind of Ores are going to make to the final cut, etc). Think of this as Engine Development

Beta 
Once we've settled on the mods, I'd like to begin to do bug testing and more cross mod integration. At this stage I'd like to add HQM so that we can begin creating not only a lore but also a structure to help the player progress, a guide to let them know exactly what it is, tools wise, that they have at their disposal. Initial balancing tweaks as well in terms of health / etc. All that fun stuff

RC 
Settled on Mods this would be purely balancing trying to get things right, making sure the game feels right at every stage, from the very first time you log into the world, until you are standing upon a monument to your own arrogance

Release 
This will ultimately be mod updates, and keeping things in check
